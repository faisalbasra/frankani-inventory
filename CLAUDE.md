## üîÑ Important: Always Update This File

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** After completing any task, feature, or significant change, you MUST update the "Project Status & Progress" section at the bottom of this file to reflect. Always use Conventional Commits and never work or commit to main branch directly, always use feature branch and create pull request.

1. Move completed items from "‚è≥ Pending" to "‚úÖ Completed"
2. Update the "üöß In Progress" section with current work
3. Add new pending tasks that were discovered during development
4. Update the completion percentage estimate
5. Modify "Next Steps" based on current priorities

This ensures continuity between different Claude Code sessions and provides clear project visibility.
